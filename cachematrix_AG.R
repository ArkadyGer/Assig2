## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

## function takes the inverse of a matrix and saves it to cache (variable d)

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    d<<-solve(c)
    d
}


## function checks whether the inverse of a matrix is already stored in cache (variable d)

cacheSolve <- function(x) 
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
{    e<-solve(c)
if (identical(e,d))
{d}else
{e}}
